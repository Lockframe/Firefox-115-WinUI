# Firefox 115 WinUI
An edited version of an old release of [bmFtZQ](https://github.com/bmFtZQ)'s [Edge-frfx](https://github.com/bmFtZQ/Edge-FrFox) theme with some [tweaks by MrOtherGuy](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/firefox-csshacks) to match Microsoft's WinUI design guidelines.

## Note: This theme is currently only compatible with Firefox 115 ESR due to the removal of support for `-moz-win-borderless-glass` and `-moz-win-glass`.
